	The elves are a race that boast long lives that allow them a deep understanding \
	of the world few other races can achieve. They saw themselves as stewards of the world, \
	above the struggles of the more transient, mortal races. Over centuries, they withdrew \
	from the rest of the world, focused on their own society and their internal affairs, \
	watching the rise and fall of empires from the safety of their secluded sanctuaries. \
	They believed their superiority set them apart, and so they chose to remain apart, \
	believing that the troubles of the world would never truly affect them.<br><br>\
	They had isolated themselves so thoroughly that they had failed to see the growing darkness \
	that was slowly consuming the world. They ignored the signs, dismissed the warnings from those \
	outside their borders, and continued to focus on their own pursuits. By the time they realized \
	the severity of the threat, it was too late. The necromantic forces were already upon them, \
	and the elves, unprepared and isolated, were unable to mount a coordinated defense. \
	Where once they were seen as the pinnacle of civilization, they are now regarded with \
	a mixture of pity, resentment, and distrust.<br><br>\
