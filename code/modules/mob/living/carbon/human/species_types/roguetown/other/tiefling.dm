	Demons were weapons of war, built by ancient wizards to wage total, unending conflict. \
	Over time, however, these beings evolved far beyond their creators' expectations. \
	Some came possess necromancy themselves, a power that enabled them to alter, improve, \
	and create life itselfâ€”an ability that made them comparable to a self-improving machines. \
	Demons became exponentially more powerful, surpassing even the wizards who had designed them. \
	In a swift and devastating uprising, they eliminated their creators and seized control over Hell, \
	transforming it into a domain of their own making.<br><br>\
	From Hell, the upper echelons of demons stretch their influence to the rest of their world, \
	reaching across to manipulate and corrupt. They sow chaos, seeking to make life in the world \
	as fraught and difficult as possible. Yet, for those willing to serve, they often grant dark favors. \
	Tieflings are the hybrid offspring of humans and demons. Though some are indeed the rare result \
	of human and demon unions, most arise from demonic interference with unborn humans. \
	Touched by these dark forces while still in the womb, these children are born with a trace \
	of demon blood.<br><br>\
	These dark influences mark tieflings with an instinctual affinity toward wickedness; \
	many feel a natural pull toward selfishness, cruelty, or deception. Though many choose \
	to resist their inherited inclinations.<br><br>\
